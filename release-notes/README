The data used by the Release Notes document is partially generated by
scripts.

The scripts are in ../scripts. bitbake-metadata.sh is the main script.

bitbake-metadata.sh relies on the existence of the following
directories:

* the BSP directory: the directory where you initialized the
  fsl-community-bsp repository
  (https://github.com/Freescale/fsl-community-bsp-platform) with
  `repo'

* the gitdm directory: a clone of the
  https://github.com/OSSystems/gitdm repository (to generate
  statistics for the Acknowledgements section)

* the Documentation directory: this very repository.  Note that
  bitbake-metadata.sh assumes Documentation to be found in
  $BSPDIR/sources

To run bitbake-metadata.sh, change to the scripts directory and run it
with the BSP directory, the gitdm repository directory, the initial
tag and the end tag (to gather commit statistics).  Here's an example:

  $ cd ../scripts
  $ bitbake-metadata.sh ~/src/fsl-community-bsp ~/src/gitdm 1.5 1.6

By default, bitbake-metadata.sh collects data out of bitbake's
metadata for all machines it can find in the meta-fsl-arm and
meta-fsl-arm-extra layers.  You can restrict the machines to collect
data from by setting the MACHINES variable in your environment.

bitbake-metadata.sh will write its output to release-note's `source'
directory.

To generate the formatted output for the release notes document, you
need to run "make <target>" from the release-notes directory.  It will
then use the data generated by bitbake-metadata2doc.sh.
