Fsl-community-bsp supports two sources for u-boot:


* **u-boot-imx**: U-Boot supported by Freescale
* **u-boot-fslc**: provides the U-Boot |u_boot_fslc_version| version with backported
  fixes and configuration patches related with meta-oe/yocto.
* **u-boot-boundary**: provides the U-Boot |u_boot_boundary_version| supported by
  Boundary Devices. This repository is basicaly kept in-line with true main-line U-Boot,
  but used it as a staging area due to responsive to customer needs. The primary deltas
  at this point are additional boards (nit6xlite is not yet in main-line), support
  for additional displays, and support for custom boards.
* **u-boot-cubox-i**: provides the U-Boot 2013.10 version supported by SolidRun
  with additional patches for SPL and CuBox-i support.
* **u-boot-timesys**: provides the U-Boot 2011.12 version with additional
  patches for pcl052 and pcm052 support.
